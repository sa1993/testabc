PROJECT NAME:- 
Restaurant Management System

DESCRIPTION:- 
The purpose of this project was to calculate the total cost of the items ordered in a restaurant, by pressing the buttons created on the frame.

ABOUT THE PROJECT:- 
*I imported a module named "tkinter" to make designing and frames like text boxes, labels buttons etc.  

*Size of the form was made by using a component called "root.geometry", and was shown by 
 "root.mainloop()". Also, to have this form page on the full screen, I used   
 "root.state('zoomed')".

*Buttons were created on root, having various texts like "login", "id", "password", etc, followed by 
 another component called "pack()", used to pack it.

*Now, to make the buttons work, I made a function "def()", and called that function.

*To make a textbox, I used "Entry(root)".

*"Label" was made to give caption for the textbox.

*For coloring and background designs, I used various components like "bg", "fg", "font" etc.

*I also imported datetime. "time.asctime" takes the local time from our 
 system.

*Then, various variables were taken for costing of items.

*For calculation, a reference no. is automatically generated, by using 
 "random.randint". Here, "else-if" statement was also used, so that if 
 no order was made, then it's value becomes zero.
